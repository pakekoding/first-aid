[MISSION FAILED]

it's okay to fail
sometimes you have to fail to learn a valuable lesson
and accept the failure
then, get up
and started walking again slowly
make your achievements your travel companion
and believe me, you will arrive at your destination
goals you've worked so hard to maintain
goals that sacrifice a lot of your time and energy
